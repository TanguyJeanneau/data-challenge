#Context

Recent virtual or augmented reality devices offer new 3D environment in which we need new and precise manner to interact. Hands can offer an intuitive and effective tool in these applications. Some gestures, as swipes, are more defined by the hand motion (called here coarse gesture) while others are defined by the hand shape through the gesture (called fine gesture). This difference between useful gestures have to be taken into account in a hand gesture recognition algorithm.

Effective and inexpensive depth sensors, like the Intel RealSense or the Leap Motion Controller provide precise skeletal data of the hand and fingers in the form of a full 3D skeleton corresponding to 22 joints. Hand skeletal data could handle a precise information of the hand shape that HCI applications need in order to use the hand as a manipulation tool. In this challenge, we present a 3D dynamic hand gesture dataset which provides sequences of hand gestures in the form of 3D skeletal data.

The Intel RealSense short range depth camera is used to collect our dataset.
